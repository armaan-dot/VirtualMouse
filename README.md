# Virtual-Mouse

A virtual mouse is software that allows users to give mouse inputs to a
system without using an actual mouse. To the extreme, it can also be called
as hardware because it uses an ordinary web camera. A virtual mouse can
usually be operated with multiple input devices, including an
actual mouse or a computer keyboard. The virtual mouse, which uses a web
camera, works with the help of different image processing techniques.
